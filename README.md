# WaterNow
In Bangalore, many housing societies face water shortages, leading to unequal access and inefficient resource utilization. Water scarcity affects daily life, hygiene, and overall well-being.

WaterNow is a comprehensive water management system specifically designed for housing societies. Society administrators utilize this application to monitor water levels within each society and forecast water demand. By facilitating water sharing between societies, WaterNow ensures efficient allocationâ€”transferring water from surplus societies to those facing scarcity. This innovative system aims to optimize water usage, address water scarcity issues, and promote sustainable water management practices in residential areas.
